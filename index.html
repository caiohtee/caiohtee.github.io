    <div id="wabwad">By the light of the LED display of the VCR recorder,
You kiss my neck, I whisper in your ear: this is my downfall.
As you squint and you grimace, we both know your heart's not in it.

By the glow of a thousand fireflys in a travelodge en-suite,
They think the future's bright as halogen, we know it's pretty bleak.
And I am trying to be sexy, biting at the air that falls in front of me.

Your telegrams are more and more less detailed by the day,
And all the characters are strangers and the pubs have different names,
I tell a joke, I'd like to meet them but they loathe me and I hate them back.

Absence makes the heart grow fonder, fondness makes the absence longer,
Length loses my interest, I'm a realist, I'm insatiable.
Swapped counting days until I fly, with hours before your reply.

You said he got his teeth fixed,
I'm gonna break them,
I've got a heart on fire.
He said he's got his sights set,
On getting to you,
I've got fist on fire.

And you feel terrified at the thought of being left behind,
Of losing everybody, the necessity of dying.
Oh we kid ourselves there's future in the fucking,
But there is no fucking future.
I'm just practising my accents, picking at old sutures.

I taught myself the only way to vaguely get along in love,
Is to like the other slightly less than you get in return,
I keep feeling like I'm being undercut.

Charlotte says it's more constructive than the one in Canada,
When you got drunk, ate loads of crisps,
And threw up by a football pitch.
I know it is,
And really that's what worries me,
I feel like I should hurt.

You said he's got his teeth fixed,
I'm gonna break them,
I've got a heart on fire.
He said he's got his sights set,
I'm getting to you,
I've got fist on fire.

I cannot emphasise enough that my body,
Is a badly designed, poorly put together vessel,
Harbouring these diminishing, so called vital organs,
Hope my heart goes first,
I hope my heart goes first.

We are beautiful,
We are doomed. </div>
    
    <div id="byhhh"><p> By your hand is the only end I foresee,
I have been dreaming,
you've been dreaming about me.

By your hand is the only end I foresee,
I have been dreaming,
you've been dreaming about me.

I was sitting on my hands at the top-deck of the 178,
spitting cusses at my face reflected in the windscreen pane.
Throwing insults and calling names.
Filthy SMS's that you sent through the day,
by sundown, become tame,
so I set it in motion again.

But fates a cruel mistress, girl, the prettiest in the world.
She dresses loosely in a bathrobe with her hair up in curls,
cause we were kissing for hours with her hands in my trousers,
she could not contain herself, suggests we go back to her house.
But here it comes, this is the crux, she vomits down my rental tux.

I'm not sure if it's love anymore,
but I've been thinking of you fondly for sure.
Remember what your heart is for.

By your hand is the only end I foresee,
I have been dreaming,
you've been dreaming about me.

By your hand is the only end I foresee,
I have been dreaming,
you've been dreaming about me.

And it's a good night,
For a fist fight,
Because the dew will temper your fall,
You'll sing me lullabies in form of your cat-calls.

And I've been dangling in limbo, barely keeping my cool.
It's like I'm snookered between the back cushion and touching the 8 ball.
I keep replaying my turn, until your patience is shot,
you peel your white gloves off seductively before you re-spot.
Your fingertips leave marks and graze,
I lay you down atop the baize,

I'm not sure if it's love anymore,
but I've been thinking of you fondly for sure.
Remember what your heart is for.

Graceful, gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.
My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.

By your hand is the only end I foresee, (My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.)
I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me. (My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.)

By your hand is the only end I foresee, (My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.)
        I have been dreaming, you've been dreaming about me. (My gracious companion with your eyes of doe and thighs of stallion.) </p></div>
